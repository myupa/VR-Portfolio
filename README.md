# XR Portfolio 2022 - Emmy Yupa

This portfolio includes the below:

"VR Tools," a Unity VR project expanding BNG's VR Interaction Framework with tools to provide interaction guidance and more to players in VR. For example: display guide hands on grabbable objects, based on a player's dominant hand. Highlight collider triggers to guide interaction. Reset items to their point of origin. And for underwater scenarios: create water waves using hand motion to affect the environment, and trigger bioluminescence through physical contact or water waves. This includes scripts in VR Tools Scripts. This project can be downloaded at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_v7PDv75qlZv9y-9Pty3BquM4xxyFNZI

"Your Life Underwater" scripts. Currently in development, using Unity for the Magic Leap. This project overlays an underwater mesh to immerse the player in an AR aquarium built upon their environment. Sea-life grows spontaneously on and swims around the playerâ€™s living room, office, or anywhere. Using hand-tracking, players can also push water around and interact with bioluminescent fish and seaweeds. Arriving late Summer 2022. An in-progress build can be downloaded at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wDsLL7bgWyPbL5fDd2yNdqK3kcu0nMwp

"Your Next Dream Will Begin Shortly" and "Decay Exists As An Extant Form Of Life," two Unity VR experiences built for the Meta Quest. This also includes 3D models in Character Models and scripts in VR Experience Scripts. The experiences can be downloaded as a single build at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PZkRtXg8s0e0PVX5H7qOtgyaEfJkA6e_

"The Train Rumbles Overhead Like A Warm Thunderstorm," an Unreal VR Experience for Windows Desktop. The experience can be downloaded at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vhTikk6SuGdOb-yDCZXgf5R3yQwGbn0t

Cat Simulator, a Unity project for Windows Desktop. This build can be downloaded at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qfMWHw0OZYZ2PcLaTRl9NPbut-I_zcSJ

"Photon," a collection of scripts implementing Photon to network values, game objects, and animation in Unity for multiplayer experiences.

FOR UNITY VR PORTFOLIO: 
I used BNG's VR Interaction Framework for VR player interaction.
http://www.beardedninjagames.com/vr-framework/

I created the environments in both experiences from mixing and matching individual trees, boulders, and more into forests, mountains, caves, and city streets.
Components provided by: JustCreate, Mahall Games, Greyroad Studio, Boxophobic, Beetheart Creative Studio.

Torch Flickering Effect: LightFlickerEffect.cs. Written by Steve Streeting 2017. License: CC0 Public Domain 

Forest Goddess in "Your Next Dream...": Used MakeHuman to create the 3D character, then used Blender to add a gold flowing robe and animations.

Office Fish in "Your Next Dream...": Created the fish's body and animations in Blender. 

Shadow Figures in "Decay Exists..." I used Mixamo characters and animations as their basis. I modified the character's materials to give them their dark, shadowy appearance, and added emissive white capsules to give them their glowing eyes.

Hand Torch in "Decay Exists...": Used SimpleModelsForMe's hand torch as the basis, and modified the materials and meshes.

Mushrooms in "Decay Exists...": Imported JustCreate's Low-Poly Simple Nature Pack's mushroom models into Blender, modified their appearance and materials,
and gave them menacing animations.

FOR CAT SIMULATOR:
Used MalberS Animations' Animal Controller to create the character controller. Used Indie Cat's Low Poly Cats for cat model.

FOR ROLLING THUNDER:
I created the Subway Station, train, and rats using the below 3D models, and remixed audio samples from Freesound.org to create the environment audio and soundtrack.
I used Blueprints to keep track of and further player interaction, then used Sequencer to play the story's scenes.
