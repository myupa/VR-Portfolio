Used BNG's VR Interaction Framework for VR player interaction.

I created the environments in both experiences from mixing and matching individual trees, boulders, and more into forests, mountains, caves, and city streets.
Components provided by: JustCreate, Mahall Games, Greyroad Studio, Boxophobic, Beetheart Creative Studio.

Office Fish in "Your Next Dream...": Created the fish's body and animations in Blender. 

Shadow Figures in "Decay Exists..." I used Mixamo characters and animations as their basis. I modified the character's materials to give them their dark, shadowy appearance, and added emissive white capsules to give them their glowing eyes.

Hand Torch in "Decay Exists...": Used SimpleModelsForMe's hand torch as the basis, and edited the materials and meshes.

Mushrooms in "Decay Exists...": Imported JustCreate's Low-Poly Simple Nature Pack's mushroom models into Blender, modified their appearance and materials,
and gave them menacing animations.
